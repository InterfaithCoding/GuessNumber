# 'Guess the Number' - our first computer game
In this session we will be building the 'Guess the Number' game that we planned for last week - using Python. 

Work through the walkthrough with your pair, typing out the code exactly as it appears. (No copy and pasting - that's cheating!) Remember to get the spacing and syntax exact, computers aren't as forgiving as your English teacher! 

If there is something that you don't understand - ask your pair to explain it to you, that's part of the reason why it's so useful having a pair. Don't be afraid to ask Hannah or Google any questions you have.
