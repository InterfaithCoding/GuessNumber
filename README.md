# 'Guess the Number' - our first computer game
In this session we will be building the 'Guess the Number' game that we planned for last week - using Python. 

Work through the walkthrough with your pair, typing out the code exactly as it appears. (No copy and pasting - that's cheating!) Remember to get the spacing and syntax exact, computers aren't as forgiving as your English teacher! 

Please feel free to customise the programme to your liking. You can print out funny/encouraging/discouraging comments to the player's along the way. You can also change the range of the computer's guess, to make it a much harder/easier game for your player to win. This is your game - so play around in the interactive shell to see what works - have fun with it! 

If there is something that you don't understand - ask your pair to explain it to you, that's part of the reason why it's so useful having a pair. Don't be afraid to ask Hannah or Google any questions you have.
