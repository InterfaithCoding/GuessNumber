# 'Guess the Number' - our first computer game
In this session we will be building the 'Guess the Number' game that we planned for last week - using Python. 

Work through the walkthrough with your pair, typing out the code exactly as it appears. (No copy and pasting - that's cheating!) Remember to get the spacing and syntax exact, computers aren't as forgiving as your English teacher! 

Please feel free to customise the programme to your liking. You can print out funny/encouraging/discouraging comments to the player's along the way. You can also change the range of the computer's guess, to make it a much harder/easier game for your player to win. This is your game - so play around in the interactive shell to see what works - have fun with it! 

If there is something that you don't understand - ask your pair to explain it to you, that's part of the reason why it's so useful having a pair. Don't be afraid to ask Hannah or Google any questions you have.

####NEXT WEEK

We're going to be taking all the programming concepts we learnt these past two weeks to the next level to build a 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' game

We're going to have to learn some cool front-end languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as a little about how the web works. Your creativity and imagination are going to be key - so start thinking of some ideas for your first website.

Here are a couple of example to give you some inspiration:
